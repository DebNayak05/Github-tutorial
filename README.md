Some terms -<br>
Commit changes -> This means basically recording changes that you have made to your code. Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.

Using git status -><br>
We get 4 types of status -><br>
1. Untracked - New files that git does not track yet <br>
2. Modified - Changed files <br>
3. Staged - File is ready to be commited. Means that you have ADDED the modified/untracked file to the repository but not COMMIT yet. After commit it becomes unmodified <br>
4. Unmodified - Unchanged <br>
<br><br>
ADD command - Add new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.<br>
